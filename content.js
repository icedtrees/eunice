blog review:
fail whale.
Author: Happy Apple/Eunice
Theme: Grey text on various shades of green. Peaceful green wheat-pictured background.

Unique aspects: Recent comments! Haven't seen that in any other blogs. A nice followers tab! Maybe I'll put this in my followers tab. Happy Apple tips and facts!
Review: Bright theme makes posts seem brighter when you're reading them and thinking about them. The posts themselves are pretty happy as well. "Happy Apple" really seems to suit her - happy because of the aura she exudes both in public and on her blog, and Apple because it reminds me of "an apple a day" - consistent dedication to personal health and also a responsible dedication to study. Posts daily, and always provides something interesting to read. Excited/enthusiastic perspective on everything that happens. Admirable dedication to medicine. Can't find a better word to describe it than "nice".

      `yeah, and ur life has been getting harder ever since. not only did you have to deal with your ed, u had to perform perfectly in the hsc, get into med, pass radiography, get into med again, and pass med exams - all while dealing with a ton of shit. what a life man. u never signed up for any of this. except med i guess, u signed yourself up for that. congrats again on getting into med! maybe one day u'll find something else worth fighting for.`,
